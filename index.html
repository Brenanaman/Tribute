        French military commander and emperor Napoleon Bonaparte (1769–1821) gained notoriety during the French Revolution. He was born on the island of Corsica and rose through the ranks of the military with remarkable strategic ability. He overthrew the government in a coup d'état in 1799, and in 1804, he proclaimed himself Emperor of France.

        The Napoleonic Wars, which he led to the expansion of the French Empire across most of Europe, defined Napoleon's reign. The Napoleonic Code, a collection of his legal innovations, had a long-lasting effect on civil law systems all over the world. Napoleon achieved military triumphs, but in the end, his ambitions brought him to ruin. His abdication in 1814 was the result of a disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812 and following defeats by a coalition of European nations. He was banished to the island of Elba, but before losing the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, he managed to escape and briefly reclaim power during the Hundred Days. Napoleon was banished and eventually died in exile on the isolated island of Saint Helena in 1821. His legacy continues to have an impact on contemporary judicial systems and European history.
